# shopify_confetti
Add a rain of Confetti to a Shopify Button, in my case checkout cart on hover

## How To

1. Add the liquid code snippet to the desired page (in this example cart)
2. Add the .css filke to assets (you may have to modify canvass and use an id or class for selecting)
3. Add the .js file to you Assets (you may have to modify canvas and/or button class/id)

If you have a standard Shopify Theme this will work out of the box no problem. You may get some errors if you forget to add the class to your button, that class has to be the same as the one in the .js file. If you have any other canvases on your page then you may have to specify which one in whatever way you please to the .css file.
